# Arma 3 Force Deployment

A collection of scripts for deployment conventional forces across a map.

These scripts are being developed as a SQF/Arma scripting learning exercise. The hope is that they can eventually be evolved into a generic system for passing in well-defined conventional force ORBATs and deploying that force in appropriate formations and semi-random positions.
